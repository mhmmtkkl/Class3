/*
 * in abstract we ll use abstract keyword to make method and the class abstract 
 * 
 * 		boring questions?
 * 
 * 			if one class non-abstract we can not have abstract method 
 * 
 * 			variables can not be abtract 
 * 
 * 			
 * 			abstract class can have a non-abstract method 
 * 			
 * 			abstract class can contains multiple abstract methods
 * 
 * 			abstract methods dont have a body
 *		
 *		
 *		what abstract keyword those? 			
 *		
 *			when we extend our abstract in other class then we have to implement abstract methods 
 *
